# SSE L2 Head Block Fix Summary

## Problem
- L2 Head Block showing "N/A" in dashboard
- 524 errors on SSE `/sse/l2-head` endpoint after some time
- Fallback to `/l2-head-block` endpoint also failing

## Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Issue**: ClickHouse performance degradation causing both SSE and fallback endpoints to timeout
**Secondary Issue**: Inadequate error handling and timeout configuration in SSE streams

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Database Query Optimization (`crates/clickhouse/src/reader.rs`)
- **Before**: `SELECT max(l2_block_number) AS number FROM l2_head_events`
- **After**: `SELECT l2_block_number FROM l2_head_events ORDER BY l2_block_number DESC LIMIT 1`
- **Benefit**: ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is typically faster on large tables and can utilize indexes more efficiently

### 2. SSE Resilience Improvements (`crates/api/src/lib.rs`)
- **Query Timeouts**: Added 30-second timeout to prevent indefinite hangs
- **Error Handling**: Exponential backoff on consecutive failures
- **Caching**: Send last known values during database outages
- **Keep-Alive**: More aggressive keep-alive (every 15 seconds) to prevent proxy timeouts
- **Adaptive Polling**: Back off polling frequency during error states

### 3. Error Recovery Mechanisms
- Reset error count on successful queries
- Use cached values after 5+ consecutive errors
- Graceful degradation instead of complete failure

## Expected Improvements
1. **Faster Database Queries**: ORDER BY with LIMIT should be more efficient than MAX()
2. **Better SSE Connection Stability**: Improved keep-alive prevents proxy timeouts
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Dashboard continues showing data even during database issues
4. **Reduced Load**: Adaptive polling reduces database pressure during problems

## Testing Recommendations
1. Monitor SSE connection stability over time
2. Check for any database query performance improvements
3. Verify that L2 Head Block no longer shows "N/A" during database slowdowns
4. Test fallback behavior during simulated database outages

## Future Enhancements (If Needed)
- Add database connection pooling optimization
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for database calls
- Add metrics collection for SSE connection health
- Consider using Redis or similar for caching block numbers

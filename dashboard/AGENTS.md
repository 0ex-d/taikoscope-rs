# Dashboard Agent Guidelines

## Build & Serve
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Start the dev server with `npm run dev`.
- Build for production with `npm run build`.
- Run type checks with `npm run check` whenever you modify dashboard code and ensure this passes before opening a PR.

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript and keep components typed.
- Format using `prettier`.

## Git
- Use Conventional Commits for commits.
